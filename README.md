# IMDBvsRottenTomatoes
Python web scrape of popular tv shows and how well they did on each platform. On IMDB I chose the https://www.imdb.com/chart/tvmeter/?sort=rk,asc&mode=simple&page=1 and on RottenTomates I used https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/tv_series_browse/critics:fresh~sort:popular?page=1.
After the data is collected I will compare the two lists with comments, ratings, and Meta score.
Libraies currently used are pprint, re, html, numpy, BeautifulSoup and string.
